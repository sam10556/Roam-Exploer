        <h2>Day-1</h2>
        <p>
            As you reach here what you might wanna do is to play with snow or have a snowball fight but you also do have to take care about the clothes that you carry and I would recommend you to carry long coats as it gets too cold during winter season. So on first day we enjoyed all the adventurous stuff like skiing & Quad biking at Solang Valley(p.s.- always do bargaining in these activities). We stayed in hotel Meadows it's cheap(around 800 rupees per night) and located near mall road.

        <h2>Day-2</h2>
        <p>
            After having the breakfast at the hotel we went out to visit Vashisht temple & Kullu Palace. After spending half of the day we wanted to try the snack which is quiet famous in Manali & that was the noodles. The street vendors will serve you in few minutes and I can bet that it would be the best feeling to have noodles in that kind of environment.
